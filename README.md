# The Papier icon theme
![Icons](samples/together.svg)

_49 icons from the set. It truly screams GORGEOUS._

Paper was discontinued. It's even archived now. Everyone forgot about it and now uses Papirus.

Until now.

This is an icon theme based on Papirus, but with many Paper icons. Look at the image, a picture is worth a thousand words.
