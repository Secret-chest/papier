# The Papier icon theme
![Icons](artwork/banner-w-l.svg)

[Paper](https://github.com/snwh/paper-icon-theme) was discontinued. It's even archived now. Everyone forgot about it and now uses Papirus.

Until now.

This is an icon theme based on [Papirus](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme), but with many Paper icons. Look at the image, a picture is worth a thousand words.

## How to install

Go to the releases page and download `Papier.zip`. Extract it in your `.icons` folder and enjoy.
